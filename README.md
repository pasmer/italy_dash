### The Covid19 Italy Dashboard

**The Coronavirus Dashboard**

Ver. 1.2

This Covid19 Italy dashboard provides an overview of the 2019 Novel
Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Italy.

I built this dashboard with R then I deployed it in my personal R Shiny
Server to give evereybody access.

The aim of this dashboard is to provide an insight for the <b>business
decision-makers</b>, for that the next improvements will consider the
economic impacts and the scenario analysis with a <b>risk management</b>
point of view.
